# Secret-Messages
The job is to take a few of the famous ciphers listed here and implement them in Python so you can quickly encode
and decode secret messages. Each cipher should be created as a Python class and each has to expose two methods:
encrypt and decrypt. Each of these methods should take a single string to be encoded or decoded and should
return the properly encoded or decoded version of the string according to the cipher.
